Alert Incident Commander for P0/P1\n\n2. **Begin containment**\n   - Stop data processing if needed\n   - Isolate affected systems\n   - Preserve evidence\n\n3. **Establish communication channel**\n   - Create dedicated Slack channel\n   - Start bridge call for P0/P1\n   - Document all actions\n\n### **Step 3: Assessment & Planning (15-30 minutes)**\n1. **Detailed impact assessment**\n   - Affected systems and data\n   - Business impact scope\n   - Customer impact analysis\n   - Regulatory implications\n\n2. **Root cause investigation**\n   - Review logs and monitoring\n   - Interview involved personnel\n   - Identify contributing factors\n\n3. **Develop response plan**\n   - Containment strategy\n   - Recovery steps\n   - Communication plan\n   - Resource requirements\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Incident-Specific Procedures\n\n### **Data Breach Response**\n\n#### **Immediate Actions (0-30 minutes)**\n1. **Contain the breach**\n   ```bash\n   # Disable affected user accounts\n   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name suspicious-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSDenyAll\n   \n   # Block suspicious IP addresses\n   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-12345 --protocol tcp --port 443 --source-group sg-67890\n   \n   # Rotate potentially compromised credentials\n   aws iam create-access-key --user-name affected-service-account\n   aws iam delete-access-key --user-name affected-service-account --access-key-id OLD_KEY_ID\n   ```\n\n2. **Preserve evidence**\n   - Take system snapshots\n   - Collect relevant logs\n   - Document timeline\n\n3. **Assess scope**\n   - Identify compromised data\n   - Determine number of affected records\n   - Classify data sensitivity\n\n#### **Investigation & Recovery (30 minutes - 4 hours)**\n1. **Forensic analysis**\n   - Determine attack vector\n   - Identify all affected systems\n   - Assess attacker capabilities\n\n2. **Legal notifications** (within 72 hours for GDPR)\n   - Notify data protection authorities\n   - Prepare customer notifications\n   - Coordinate with legal counsel\n\n3. **System hardening**\n   - Patch vulnerabilities\n   - Strengthen access controls\n   - Update monitoring rules\n\n### **Data Quality Incident Response**\n\n#### **Detection & Assessment**\n1. **Identify quality issue**\n   ```sql\n   -- Check data quality metrics\n   SELECT \n       table_name,\n       quality_dimension,\n       score,\n       threshold,\n       CASE WHEN score < threshold THEN 'FAIL' ELSE 'PASS' END as status\n   FROM data_quality_metrics \n   WHERE check_date = CURRENT_DATE\n   AND status = 'FAIL';\n   ```\n\n2. **Assess impact**\n   - Downstream systems affected\n   - Reports and dashboards impacted\n   - Business decisions based on bad data\n\n3. **Quarantine bad data**\n   ```python\n   # Mark problematic data\n   def quarantine_data(table_name, quality_issue):\n       query = f\"\"\"\n       UPDATE {table_name}\n       SET data_quality_flag = 'QUARANTINED',\n           quality_issue_reason = '{quality_issue}',\n           quarantine_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n       WHERE quality_score < threshold\n       \"\"\"\n       execute_query(query)\n   ```\n\n#### **Root Cause Analysis**\n1. **Check data lineage**\n   -
