# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Template

Framework for documenting technical decisions in analytics projects. ADRs create a historical record of important architectural choices, helping teams understand the context and rationale behind technical decisions.

## 🎯 ADR Purpose & Benefits

### **Why Use ADRs**
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture decision context for future team members
- **Decision Accountability**: Clear ownership and rationale for choices
- **Learning Tool**: Understanding why decisions were made helps improve future choices
- **Onboarding Aid**: New team members can understand system evolution

### **When to Write an ADR**
- Technology stack decisions (databases, frameworks, tools)
- Architecture patterns and design approaches
- Data modeling strategies and schemas
- Integration patterns and API designs
- Security and compliance approaches
- Performance optimization strategies

## Context
We need to select a cloud data warehouse technology for our analytics platform. 
Current requirements:
- Handle 10TB+ of data with room for 10x growth
- Support both structured and semi-structured data
- Integrate with our existing AWS infrastructure
- Support real-time and batch processing
- Cost-effective for our expected usage patterns
- Support for dbt and other modern data tools

## Decision
We will use Amazon Redshift as our primary data warehouse technology.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- Native AWS integration reduces operational complexity
- Excellent performance for analytical workloads

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Snowflake
- Description: Cloud-native data warehouse with automatic scaling
- Pros: Superior handling of semi-structured data, automatic scaling, minimal management
- Cons: Higher cost for our usage patterns, additional vendor relationship
- Why rejected: Cost analysis showed 40% higher expense for our projected usage

### Alternative 2: BigQuery
- Description: Google Cloud's serverless data warehouse
- Pros: Serverless, pay-per-query model, excellent for ad-hoc analytics
- Cons: Would require multi-cloud strategy, different SQL dialect, data transfer costs
- Why rejected: Team lacks GCP expertise, multi-cloud complexity

### Alternative 3: Databricks
- Description: Unified analytics platform for big data and ML

### **Example 2: API Design Pattern**
```markdown
# ADR-002: REST API Design for Analytics Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to design APIs for our analytics platform that will serve data to:
- Internal dashboards and applications
- External customer integrations
- Mobile applications
- Third-party analytics tools

Key requirements:
- Consistent interface across all endpoints
- Support for filtering, pagination, and sorting
- Efficient data transfer for large datasets
- Versioning strategy for backwards compatibility
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## Decision
We will implement RESTful APIs following OpenAPI 3.0 specification with:
- Resource-based URLs
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

- Clear resource-based mental model
- HTTP caching can be leveraged effectively
- Wide client library support

### Negative Consequences  
- Not optimal for complex queries with multiple resources
- Over-fetching/under-fetching compared to GraphQL
- Multiple requests needed for related data
- Versioning strategy requires careful planning

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: GraphQL
- Description: Query language allowing clients to request specific data
- Pros: Eliminates over-fetching, single endpoint, strong typing
- Cons: Higher complexity, caching challenges, learning curve for team

### **Example 3: Data Modeling Strategy**
```markdown
# ADR-003: Dimensional Modeling for Analytics Data Warehouse

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to design the data model for our analytics data warehouse. The model should:
- Support fast analytical queries for business intelligence
- Be understandable by business users and analysts
- Scale to handle growing data volumes
- Support both historical analysis and real-time reporting
- Integrate data from multiple source systems

Current data sources:
- CRM system (customer data)
- E-commerce platform (orders, products)
- Marketing automation (campaigns, events)
- Support system (tickets, interactions)

## Decision
We will implement a dimensional modeling approach using star schemas with:
- Fact tables for measurable business events
- Dimension tables for descriptive attributes
- Slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 2) for historical tracking
- Conformed dimensions shared across business processes

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- Optimized for analytical queries and business intelligence
- Intuitive model structure for business users
- Excellent query performance with proper indexing
- Mature design pattern with extensive documentation
- Supports historical analysis through SCD implementation

### Negative Consequences
- Data duplication across dimension tables
- ETL complexity for maintaining dimension integrity
- Less flexible for operational queries
- Requires careful design of grain and conformity

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Data Vault
- Description: Normalized approach with hubs, links, and satellites
- Pros: Highly auditable, flexible for changing requirements, parallel loading
- Cons: Complex query writing, requires specialized knowledge, more storage
- Why rejected: Team lacks Data Vault expertise, complexity outweighs benefits

### Alternative 2: One Big Table (OBT)
- Description: Single denormalized table per business process
- Pros: Simple queries, fast aggregations, easy to understand
- Cons: Data duplication, update complexity, limited flexibility
- Why rejected: Poor scalability, maintenance nightmare as data grows

### Alternative 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Description: Normalized relational model
- Pros: Eliminates redundancy, familiar to team, operational efficiency
- Cons: Complex joins for analytics, poor query performance
- Why rejected: Optimized for transactions, not analytics

## Implementation
Core fact and dimension tables:

**Fact Tables:**
- fact_orders (grain: one row per order line item)
- fact_customer_interactions (grain: one row per customer interaction)
- fact_marketing_campaigns (grain: one row per campaign/customer/day)

**Dimension Tables:**
- dim_customers (SCD Type 2 for attribute changes)
- dim_products (SCD Type 2 for product changes)
- dim_date (standard date dimension)
- dim_geography (customer locations)

Implementation steps:
1. Design logical model with business stakeholders
2. Create physical model in dbt
3. Implement SCD Type 2 logic for customer and product dimensions
4. Build fact table loading processes
5. Create data quality tests and monitoring
6. Develop initial set of business intelligence reports

## Validation
Success metrics:
- Query performance: 95% of BI queries complete in <10 seconds
- Data freshness: All tables updated within 4 hours of source changes
- Business adoption: 20+ active BI reports within 2 months
- Data quality: <1% failed quality checks

## Timeline
- Decision Date: 2025-01-08
- Implementation Start: 2025-01-15
- Expected Completion: 2025-03-15
- Review Date: 2025-09-15

## 🔧 ADR Management Process

### **Creating an ADR**
1. **Identify Decision**: Recognize when an architectural decision needs documentation
2. **Research Options**: Investigate alternatives and gather requirements
3. **Draft ADR**: Use template to document context, decision, and consequences
4. **Review Process**: Share with relevant stakeholders for feedback
5. **Finalize**: Update status to "Accepted" and assign ADR number
6. **Communicate**: Share decision with broader team

### **ADR Lifecycle States**
- **Proposed**: Initial draft under review
- **Accepted**: Decision approved and being implemented
- **Rejected**: Decision was considered but not chosen
- **Deprecated**: Decision no longer relevant due to changing requirements
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (reference new ADR)

### **Review and Updates**
- Schedule regular reviews of accepted ADRs (quarterly or bi-annually)
- Update status if circumstances change
- Create new ADRs when significant changes are needed
- Link related ADRs to maintain decision history
