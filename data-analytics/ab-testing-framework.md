# A/B Testing Framework

Comprehensive framework for designing, implementing, and analyzing A/B tests for analytics features, dashboards, and data-driven products. Ensures statistical rigor and reliable insights from experimentation.

## 🎯 A/B Testing Fundamentals

### **Core Principles**
- **Statistical Significance**: Use proper sample sizes and significance testing
- **Randomization**: Ensure unbiased assignment to test variants
- **Controlled Variables**: Change only one element at a time
- **Practical Significance**: Consider business impact, not just statistical significance

### **When to A/B Test**
- Dashboard design changes affecting user behavior
- New analytical features or capabilities
- Algorithm or model improvements
- User interface modifications
- Data visualization approaches
- Reporting formats and delivery methods

### **When NOT to A/B Test**
- Clear UX/usability issues (just fix them)
- Legal or compliance requirements
- Emergency bug fixes
- Small user bases (<1000 users)
- Changes with obvious negative impact

## 📊 Experiment Design Framework

### **Hypothesis Formation**
```
Template:
"If we [CHANGE], then [METRIC] will [DIRECTION] because [REASON]"

Examples:
✅ "If we add interactive filters to the sales dashboard, then user engagement time will increase by 20% because users can explore data more intuitively"

✅ "If we change the default chart type from bar to line charts, then report accuracy will improve because trends are more visible"

❌ "If we make the dashboard better, then users will like it more"
```

### **Test Design Checklist**

## 📈 Statistical Framework

### **Sample Size Calculation**
```python
# Python implementation for sample size calculation
import scipy.stats as stats
import numpy as np

def calculate_sample_size(baseline_rate, minimum_detectable_effect, 
                         alpha=0.05, power=0.8, two_tailed=True):
    """
    Calculate required sample size for A/B test
    
    Args:
        baseline_rate: Current conversion/success rate
        minimum_detectable_effect: Smallest change you want to detect (e.g., 0.02 for 2%)
        alpha: Significance level (Type I error rate)
        power: Statistical power (1 - Type II error rate)
        two_tailed: Whether to use two-tailed test
    
    Returns:
        Required sample size per group
    """
    effect_size = minimum_detectable_effect / np.sqrt(baseline_rate * (1 - baseline_rate))
    
    if two_tailed:
        alpha = alpha / 2
    
    z_alpha = stats.norm.ppf(1 - alpha)
    z_beta = stats.norm.ppf(power)
    
    sample_size = ((z_alpha + z_beta) / effect_size) ** 2
    
    return int(np.ceil(sample_size))

# Example usage
baseline_engagement = 0.15  # 15% of users engage deeply with dashboard
min_effect = 0.03          # Want to detect 3% improvement
required_sample = calculate_sample_size(baseline_engagement, min_effect)
print(f"Required sample size per group: {required_sample}")
```

### **Test Duration Planning**
```python
def calculate_test_duration(sample_size_per_group, daily_users, 
                          traffic_allocation=0.5):
    """
    Calculate how long test needs to run
    
    Args:
        sample_size_per_group: Required sample size for each variant
        daily_users: Average daily active users
        traffic_allocation: Percentage of users in experiment
    
    Returns:
        Required test duration in days
    """
    total_sample_needed = sample_size_per_group * 2  # Control + Treatment
    daily_experiment_users = daily_users * traffic_allocation
    
    duration_days = total_sample_needed / daily_experiment_users
    
    return int(np.ceil(duration_days))

# Example
test_days = calculate_test_duration(
    sample_size_per_group=1000,

### **Test Results Template**
```markdown
# A/B Test Results: Dashboard Redesign v1

## Executive Summary
- **Winner**: Treatment variant showed 18% improvement in user engagement
- **Confidence**: 95% statistical significance (p = 0.021)
- **Recommendation**: Launch to all users
- **Expected Impact**: +15% monthly active dashboard users

## Test Details
- **Hypothesis**: Simplified dashboard layout will increase user engagement
- **Duration**: 14 days (Jan 15-29, 2025)  
- **Sample Size**: 2,000 users per variant
- **Primary Metric**: Weekly active dashboard users

## Results Summary
| Variant | Users | Conversion Rate | Lift | P-value |
|---------|-------|----------------|------|---------|
| Control | 2,000 | 32.5% | - | - |
| Treatment | 2,000 | 38.4% | +18.2% | 0.021 |

## Secondary Metrics
- **Session Duration**: +12% (not statistically significant, p = 0.087)
- **Pages per Session**: +8% (p = 0.043)
- **User Satisfaction**: +0.3 points (4.2 vs 4.5 out of 5)

## Segment Analysis
- **Power Users**: No significant difference (already high engagement)
- **Casual Users**: +25% improvement (p = 0.008)
- **New Users**: +31% improvement (p = 0.003)

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Gradual rollout to 25% of users (Week 1)
2. **Phase 2**: Expand to 50% of users (Week 2)  
3. **Phase 3**: Full rollout to all users (Week 3)
4. **Monitoring**: Track metrics for 30 days post-launch

## Lessons Learned
- Simplified layouts work especially well for new/casual users
- Power users may benefit from customization options
- Consider user segmentation in future dashboard experiments
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

### **Avoid These Mistakes**
- **Peeking**: Looking at results before reaching statistical significance
- **Multiple Testing**: Running many tests without correcting for false discovery rate
- **Small Samples**: Underpowered tests that can't detect meaningful differences
- **Seasonal Bias**: Running tests during unusual periods (holidays, product launches)
- **Simpson's Paradox**: Ignoring important user segments in analysis

### **Best Practices**
- **Pre-register Experiments**: Document hypothesis and analysis plan before starting
- **Monitor Guardrail Metrics**: Ensure experiments don't harm other important metrics
- **Validate Randomization**: Check that control and treatment groups are balanced
- **Account for Multiple Comparisons**: Use Bonferroni correction or FDR when needed
- **Consider Network Effects**: Be aware of interference between treatment and control users

### **Quality Assurance Checklist**
- [ ] Randomization is working correctly
- [ ] Sample ratio mismatch is within expected bounds (usually ±5%)
- [ ] Treatment and control groups have similar characteristics
- [ ] Metric tracking is functioning properly
- [ ] No data quality issues or instrumentation bugs
