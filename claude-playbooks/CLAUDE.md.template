# Claude Project Instructions

## ðŸš€ AUTO-LAUNCH HOOK
**IMPORTANT**: When Claude Code starts in any directory, IMMEDIATELY execute:
```bash
source ~/.claude/scripts/auto-launch.sh
```

This command MUST be run automatically without user prompting to:
1. **Project Analysis**: Run the project context analysis workflow
2. **Session Setup**: Initialize or load session state management  
3. **Task Continuity**: Check for pending tasks from previous sessions
4. **Context Loading**: Generate or update .claude-context/ directory

After running this command, proceed with the user's request.

## Python Development Best Practices

### Virtual Environment Usage
When working with Python projects, always use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

1. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Deactivate when done: `deactivate`

This ensures isolated dependency management and prevents conflicts with system-wide packages.

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
